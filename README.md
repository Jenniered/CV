A full stack software developer recently graduated from Makers Academy looking for a role where I can use my problem-solving skills and build on my programming knowledge in order to make a difference.

I am excited about the possibilities to work on tech which makes a positive change in society and to continue rapidly developing as a highly competent and confident developer. I am creative with strong attention to detail, and I enjoy using these traits to develop clean, tested and methodically-built code.

I bring experience as a successful fundraising manager and qualified maths teacher with a strong track record of building relationships and achieving targets. I have excellent listening skills, an analytical mind and am a valued, reliable and trusted team member. As an experienced event manager, I have a reputation for thorough, effective planning, a logical, well-organised approach and a calm, composed manner under pressure. I look forward to bringing these qualities to a development team.

## Skills

#### Collaborative working
Central to all my roles has been my ability to successfully build relationships with a wide range of stakeholders. At the blood cancer charity, Anthony Nolan, I was a successful manager of a team of three, and a senior member of the Supporter-Led Fundraising Team, a team of 14. 

As Senior Events Manager, I oversaw the delivery of our biggest event, the [London Marathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWp4VYydshM). This was a huge team effort. It involved working closely with our team to ensure good communication and effective process to recruit and support the participants. Cross-team working was also vital and I ensured great relationships with our digital, data, creative studio and marketing teams by involving them early, making effective use of planning tools like Trello and maintaining open communication. This resulted in achieving event targets and positive feedback from the other teams.

I am empathetic, a good listener and foster positive working relationships, which I also demonstrated in my project teams at Makers.  

#### Strong communication skills
At Mind, following managing a successful year of the Royal Parks Half Marathon with a team of 500 runners, I applied to become a principal partner of the event, a partnership worth over £200k.  

I developed the written application and content for the pitch, presented to the panel and won the partnership. This demonstrated both my strong written communication skills and my ability to present a persuasive case in person. 

#### Creativity and problem solving
As a fundraiser these are vital skills I have demonstrated in order to adapt to the external environment and to keep supporters engaged.  

Due to the drop in income from events during the pandemic, we underwent a restructure at Anthony Nolan and I then led a new stream of the fundraising programme focusing on new product development to generate new income.  

In the first few months, I led a pilot of a virtual Facebook challenge event which raised £86k. Building on this, I launched a second challenge, which exceeded its targets and raised over £200k. I raised my income target for new products for the financial year in the first two months and continued to develop the area using learnings. This included introducing Zapier as an automation tool so emails could be triggered to leads, as well as developing a full email journey, which increased engagement and conversion to fundraising on further challenges.  

#### Analytic thinking
I have significant experience of marketing and in my role at Anthony Nolan, I managed digital advertising with a budget of £80k, as well as email marketing. I used analysis and insight to deliver integrated marketing campaigns, continually reviewing to ensure they were data-driven. In 2019, I oversaw our most successful Great North Run recruitment campaign.

I used supporter insight to plan audience segmentation, and this was also key to the delivery and innovation for our supporter journeys. I encouraged my team to adopt a test and learn approach and we adapted future content on the basis of results analysis. For example, A/B testing email subject lines or header images. This helped ensure we could continuously improve and optimise results.  

## Voluntary work and interests
- I've been a School Governor since February 2020 at Belmont Park School, a community special school for students with social, emotional and mental health issues
- I volunteered for a CIC, Be Her Lead, at the end of 2021 and wrote a successful National Lottery Community Fund bid for £10k to support their work running empowerment workshops for girls and non-binary young people in schools
- I love the theatre, especially musicals and have been a member of City Showtunes Orchestra, playing the clarinet, for over 5 years.
