## Jennie Evans

A full stack software developer recently graduated from Makers Academy looking for a role where I can use my problem-solving skills and build on my programming knowledge in order to make a difference.

I am excited about the possibilities to work on tech which makes a positive change in society and to continue rapidly developing as a highly competent and confident developer. I am creative with strong attention to detail, and I enjoy using these traits to develop clean, tested and methodically-built code.

I bring experience as a successful fundraising manager and qualified maths teacher with a strong track record of building relationships and achieving targets. I have excellent listening skills, an analytical mind and am a valued, reliable and trusted team member. As an experienced event manager, I have a reputation for thorough, effective planning, a logical, well-organised approach and a calm, composed manner under pressure. I look forward to bringing these qualities to a development team.
